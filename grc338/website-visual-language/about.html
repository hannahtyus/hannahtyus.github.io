          <p>Founded in 1973, right in the heart of Laguna Beach, Ocean Echo Records began as a tiny seaside hideout for music lovers, surfers, artists, and anyone chasing that perfect California soundtrack. What started as a single room stacked with milk crates of vinyl has grown into a local landmark—part record shop, part community hangout, and part time machine. </p>
          <p>Back in the early days, the shop’s salty air and creaky wooden floors played host to everything from impromptu jam sessions to late-night listening parties. Travelers wandered in off Coast Highway with sand still on their feet, looking for a new album to spin after sunset. Locals knew us as the place where you could hear next summer’s anthem months before it hit the radio. </p>
          <p>Five decades later, not much has changed—and that’s exactly how we like it. We’re still analog at heart. You’ll find walls lined with classic rock, jazz, soul, punk, and rare surf pressings you won’t see anywhere else. You’ll also find the same hand-written recommendation cards, the same crackle of an old speaker warming up, and the same belief that music is meant to be felt, not just heard.</p>
          <p>Today, Ocean Echo Records continues to celebrate the spirit of Laguna Beach: creative, independent, sun-soaked, and a little rebellious. Whether you’re hunting for a hidden gem, replacing a beloved record, or just escaping the noise of modern life, our door is always open—usually with a record spinning and the ocean breeze drifting in. </p>
